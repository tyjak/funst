```funst``` is a fork of ```kunst``` by Siddharth Dushantha (Copyright © 2019)

```funst``` is a daemon that extracts the album art from the songs playing in ```mpd``` and displays them in a window or notification or screensaver. It doesn't loop on a timer, instead it waits for ```mpd``` to send a ```player``` event. When it receives a ```player``` event, it wakes up and extracts the album art of the current playing track. This makes ```funst```really lightweight and makes it idle at ```~0%``` CPU usage. If there no embbeded album art, it will try to fetch the album art from the internet.
